- Hi, Iâ€™m Stephanie Castillo and I am excited you're here! ðŸ‘‹
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in collecting, organizing, and visualizing data. My career has been mainly in Commercial Banking, but data has always been my forfront. I am a bit of a nerd when it comes to forcasting, fostering efficency, simplifying, and creating visualizations that will help 'front of house' personnel understand where they are and what they have to do to continue reaching their goals.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python and SSIS. I have taken SQL courses all of 2022 and will be learning SSRS a bit more in detail the next couple of months.
